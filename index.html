    <h2>Mom, Mommy, Jen, Jenika, Babe</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jeni. I was born and raised in Provo, UT, but have currently 
        been living in Las Vegas, NV for over 12 years. I have an amazingly supportive husband 
        and 4 living children ages 2-10. They keep me super busy. </p>
    <p>I served a mission in Louisville, KY in 2004. That allowed me to learn a new language and
        really get to know other cultures. I won't say it was the best thing I did in my life. I'll
        leave that description to being a mother. I am grateful for the mission experience though and 
        wouldn't trade it. </p>
    <p>I work part-time from home doing medical data entry. One of my goals to going back to school
        is to have a way to support my family while working from home. I am excited to learn more 
        about web design and hopefully gain a career that I love. </p>
