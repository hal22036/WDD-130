        What our website is:
	      Have you ever had a craving for warm, moist cinnamon rolls or other baked goods that you wish could be delivered to you, 
        where and when you want them? This website will provide a way for that wish to come true. There are many clear pictures 
        of these mouthwatering options to choose from. There is also a rotating menu, that is updated on occasion, especially during 
        the holiday season. 
        Available options:
        Each option comes in different flavors, order sizes, packaging, and delivery options. You can choose if you would like to 
        pick up locally, or have your order delivered to your address of choice. The choice can be made to have you order packaged 
        for a gift, or basic packaging. If you are having it delivered through the mail, there is special care packaging to help 
        keep your order from being destroyed in transit. If you are not ready to order or would like to gift some of these amazing 
        treats, there is an option for a gift certificate.
