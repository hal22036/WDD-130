            <h1>Ordering Page</h1>
                <p>
                    Ordering:
                    Once you have decided on what you want to order from the products page, you can pop on over to the ordering page and finalize your order. 
                    The prices are labeled for each product and shipping, or pickup prices are reflected. Have your address ready for the delivery option. 
                    You can complete the order form accordingly. Once you submit your order with an email address, you will receive an invoice reflecting 
                    your total and payment options. Tax will be applied according to your state tax. After payment has been received, we will process your 
                    order for the requested date. You can expect an email with updated information about your order as your order date approaches.  </p>
                <p> Why you will come back:
                    The ease of ordering these scrumptious treats, and the addictive flavors, will have you returning for more again and again. You will want 
                    to share this with your friends and family, knowing they are getting an amazing product. Here at Confection Delight Creations, we pride 
                    ourselves on providing an exceptional product that will not disappoint.  We are a family own business that produce hand made products, 
                    that you cannot find from a big-box company or warehouse. We are one of a kind and strive to bring you the best homemade flavors money 
                    can buy.
